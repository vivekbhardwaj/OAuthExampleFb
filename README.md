# OAuthExampleFb

A simple example to do OAuth through Facebook and get access to user's information and consume it in our Flask App.

First of all, we need to have a Facebook application registered with Facebook that will consume
user's information based upon the permission provided by user and return to our client application (written in Flask).
using https://developers.facebook.com we can create our Facebook application and get App ID and APP secret (which will be used in our application). 
The library that we will be using for OAuth purpose is "flask-dance" which can be installed via pip.
